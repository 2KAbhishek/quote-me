## What is this

quote-me is a minimalistic random quote machine, that hits you with random quotes.

## Inspiration

quote-me was inspired by me liking quotes and a boring saturday afternoon.

(P.S: I actually had to complete the FCC Curriculum after procrasinating forever.)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of any web browser.

## Getting quote-me

To get quote-me, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2kabhishek/quote-me
cd quote-me
# Open index.html in your browser
$EDITOR . # Take a look at the source code
```

## Using quote-me

Click on the reload button to get a new quote.

Click on the tweet button to tweet the quote.

## How it was built

quote-me was built using `HTML, CSS, jQuery` (ahh the good old days).

## Challenges faced

Analysis paralysis between scss or css. (Ya, I know XD)

## What I learned

- Re visited jQuery.
- Some css fun.

Hit the ‚≠ê button if you found this useful.
